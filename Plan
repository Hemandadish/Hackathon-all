# Overall Plan:

Since we choose topic 2(Chatbot and Voice generation model), we have planned to create a chatbot using Rasa open-source and Rasa-X.
Later, we create a demo chatbot and we tested and trained on google colab.
Then we have deployed our rasa chatbot to VM Instance on google cloud platform (GCP).
Developed a chatbot using Rasa-X server.
Create a webpage using VS code and heroku for rasa chatbot and deploy our project on google cloud platform.
Voice will be cloned using required dataset.
Voice cloning will also be done on VM instance on google cloud.
Later, Develop a different webapp on VS code and heroku and deploy our voice trained model to google cloud platform.
